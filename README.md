# Japanese TALENT dataset

## Dataset Summary:ã€€
This dataset contains recordings of eye movements and facial expressions while two participants engage in a collaborative problem-solving task online. It is a Japanese version of a TALENT dataset in French [Hamet Bagnou+ 2022]. 

Note: The use of the dataset is only permitted for research purposes.

## Data Details:
The pairs with the same number after A or B are those in which the collaborative problem-solving task was carried out. For example, pair 1 includes A01 and B01.

| Name     | Format     | Contents     |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| data/eye_movements | xlsx | Raw Tobii output data |
| data/facial_expressions | csv | Raw OpenFace output data |
| data/profile | csv | Participant information |
| data/time_stamp | csv, xlsx | Files of the start and end times of the experiment for Tobii output data and OpenFace output data. Files of speaking time in OpenFace output data |

## Data Recording Details: 
- Fifty healthy participants (age: 39.4 years old; 25 males, 25 females)
- We set up pairs of participants to work on a cooperative problem-solving task via an online communication tool
- This dataset includes behavioral signals of eye movements and facial expressions, scores from anxiety and alexithymia questionnaires and the Social Performance Rating Scale (SPRS)
- Our data collection was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Approval No. 2022-I-60)
